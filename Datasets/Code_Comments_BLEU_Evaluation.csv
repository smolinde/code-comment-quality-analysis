2,Human,"The method below can be used to check whether a user is available in the database. Takes a user ID as string parameter. Returns true if user is in database, and false if not. Run SQL query with passed user ID. In case the SQL query returns zero rows, there is no user with passed ID, so return false. In all other cases return true.","The provided method, isUserInDatabase, checks whether a user with a given UserID exists in a database. It executes a SQL query to select the username from the ""User"" table where the ID matches the provided UserID. If the query result contains no rows, the method returns false, indicating that the user is not in the database. Otherwise, it returns true.",,,,,
3,Human,"A function that checks whether entered Sudoku syntax is correct. Returns true if numbers and syntax are placed according to the rules, else false. Set variable to true. If an error will be found, it will be set to false. Loop through the whole kudos, rows and columns. If there is a number in given position, check for duplicates. In case a duplicate was found, set return variable to false and break both remaining loops for efficiency.","The correctSyntax method checks the validity of a 9x9 Sudoku grid represented as a two-dimensional array. It iterates through each cell in the grid and, for cells containing non-zero values, verifies if the value violates Sudoku rules. Specifically, it uses helper methods checkRow, checkColumn, and checkSquare to ensure that the value does not duplicate in its row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid. If any violation is detected, the method sets the correct flag to false and exits early. Finally, it returns the Boolean value of correct, indicating whether the grid adheres to Sudoku rules.",,,,,
4,Human,"Load data in JSON format from HTTP response. Check whether server returns an error based on provided API key and station ID. Extract and round the fuel price. Print the final result to LCD1602 display. If the price is e.g. 1.7, append a ""0"" for appealing look. Wait until next HTTP request.","The code processes a fuel price obtained from an API response and displays it on an LCD1602 display. It first parses the response as JSON and checks whether the response is valid by examining the ""ok"" field. If the response is invalid, an error message is displayed on the LCD, followed by a brief pause, and the program exits. For valid responses, the fuel price for a specific type of fuel is extracted, rounded to two decimal places, and displayed on the LCD. If the price requires trailing zeros for formatting, they are added before displaying. The program then pauses for 300 seconds before potentially repeating the process.",,,,,
